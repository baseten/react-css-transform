# react-css-transform

A helper library to handle nested 2D and 3D CSS transforms using matrix multiplication, 
drastically reducing the number of nested DOM elements required and making complex 
combinations of nested transformations trivial.

`<Transform2d>` was initially developed while I was working at [Pest Pulse](https://www.pestpulse.com/) 
for a zoomable/pannable map with markers.

More docs and examples coming soon!
